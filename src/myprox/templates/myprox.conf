# For making the web frontend available via TLS encryption (https):
#   Place the certificate files in the same directory as this config file:
#   'server.pem' for the server certificate
#   'key.pem' for the server private key
#   Once these files are available, TLS encryption is provided automatically.
#   See https://cherrypydocrework.readthedocs.io/deploy.html#ssl-support on certificate creation.
#   Creation of a self-signed certificate:
#   openssl req -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out server.pem -sha256 -days 365
